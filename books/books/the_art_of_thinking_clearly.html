    <h1>The Art of Thinking Clearly</h1>
    <p>A summary of Rolf Dobelli's insights on cognitive biases and decision-making</p>
</header>

<main>
    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Why You Should Visit Cemeteries</div>
        <p><strong>Survivorship Bias:</strong> People overestimate their chances of success because they only see survivors. Visiting the graves of failed projects, investments, and careers can help provide perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: Does Harvard Make You Smarter?</div>
        <p><strong>Swimmer Body Illusion:</strong> Harvard doesn't make people smarter, it selects smart people. Just as swimmers are selected for their body type, not shaped by swimming.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Why You See Shapes in the Clouds</div>
        <p><strong>Clustering Illusion:</strong> Our brain tries to create patterns out of randomness. Use statistical tools to verify patterns in data, especially in markets.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: If Fifty Million People Say Something Foolish, It Is Still Foolish</div>
        <p><strong>Social Proof:</strong> Just because others are doing something doesn't mean you should too, especially when making personal decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: Why You Should Forget About The Past</div>
        <p><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy:</strong> Decisions should be based on future benefits, not past investments. Ignore sunk costs and focus on what lies ahead.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 11: Why We Prefer a Wrong Map to None at All</div>
        <p><strong>Availability Bias:</strong> We make decisions based on easily available information. Consult others to overcome this bias and seek different perspectives.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 12: Why “No Pain, No Gain” Should Set Alarm Bells Ringing</div>
        <p><strong>It's Get Worse Before It Gets Better Fallacy:</strong> If no improvement is seen after a reasonable period, reassess the approach.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 13: Even True Stories Are Fairytales</div>
        <p><strong>Story Bias:</strong> We shape events into stories to create meaning, which often distorts reality and clouds our judgment.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 18: Don’t Pay the Lawyers by the Hour</div>
        <p><strong>Incentive Super-Response Tendency:</strong> Align incentives with outcomes to avoid inefficiency and inflated costs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 19: The Dubious Efficacy of Doctors, Consultants, and Psychotherapists</div>
        <p><strong>Regression to the Mean:</strong> Natural fluctuations in outcomes are often mistaken for the effect of interventions. Beware of attributing success to actions when it's merely a return to average.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 20: Never Judge a Decision by Its Outcome</div>
        <p><strong>Outcome Bias:</strong> Don’t judge decisions based solely on the results. Focus on the quality of the reasoning behind them.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 21: Less is More</div>
        <p><strong>Paradox of Choice:</strong> More options lead to less satisfaction. Define clear criteria before exploring your choices.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 22: You Like Me, You Really, Really Like Me</div>
        <p><strong>Liking Bias:</strong> The more we like someone, the more inclined we are to trust and follow them, even irrationally.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 23: Don’t Cling to Things</div>
        <p><strong>Endowment Effect:</strong> We overvalue what we own. Don’t let this bias affect your decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
        <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 24: The Inevitability of Unlikely Events</div>
        <p><strong>Coincidence:</strong> Rare events happen more often than we think. Don't overestimate their significance.</p>
